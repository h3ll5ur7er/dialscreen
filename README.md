# ESPHome Voice Assistant for the Guition JC3636K718C (round knob display)

A full-featured **Home Assistant Voice Assistant** running on the **Guition
JC3636K718C** - a 1.8" round 360×360 touch display with a rotary knob, speaker,
microphone and an **addressable LED ring**. It's pure ESPHome (no custom C firmware):
an always-on core plus optional screen packages you pick from one thin config.

It started as "my kid needs a physical timer" and turned into a whole puck. 🙂

## What it does

- **Voice assistant** - on-device wake word ("Alexa") via `micro_wake_word`, full
  Home Assistant Assist pipeline (STT / LLM / TTS), wake beep + music ducking. You can also
  press and hold the screen to talk (toggleable in Settings).
- **Boot splash** - a short "HELLO!" greeting with a spinning ring on startup, then the clock.
- **Music player** - `speaker` media player visible in HA / Music Assistant, with
  album art, title/artist, transport buttons and a progress bar.
- **External media player** - a transport screen for any device with HA button entities
  (HASS.agent, Kodi, a TV, Hi-Fi amp); knob controls volume, buttons send prev / play-pause / next / mute.
  Play/pause and mute icons reflect live state, plus a volume arc and a 3-bar equalizer if you
  point it at a read-only entity.
- **Timers** - set by knob or by voice; big countdown with a depleting ring,
  pause/stop, and an alarm (sound + on-screen + LED) when it finishes.
- **Device control** - a tiles screen toggling your lights/switches.
- **Home screen** - clock, date, battery, weather + room temp/humidity, with a **selectable watchface** look (Classic, Neon, Minecraft, Fortnite, or your own).
- **More screens** (all optional, knob-driven) - a weather forecast dial, a thermostat for
  any `climate` entity, and a configurable multi-sensor glance.
- **LED ring** - controllable from HA *and* reactive: assistant (comet/spinner/wave),
  timer countdown, alarm flash, volume bar - each reaction toggleable in Settings.
- **Four built-in arcade games** (a lane racer, a vertical shooter, a 360-degree snake and a Gyruss-style tube shooter) for the kid.

Everything is navigated with **swipes + taps on the screen** and the **rotary knob**.

## Screens

| Screen | View |
|:---:|---|
| <img src="assets/screens/home.png" width="170"> | **Home / Clock**<br>Time, date, battery (a bolt while charging), outdoor weather and room temperature + humidity. Pick the watchface look in Settings → Home - see [Watchfaces](#watchfaces) below. |
| <img src="assets/screens/player.png" width="170"> | **Player**<br>Album art, title & artist, prev / play-pause / next and a progress bar. Auto-shows when playback starts. |
| <img src="assets/screens/controls.png" width="170"> | **Control tiles** (swipe up)<br>Four configurable tiles toggling any HA entity; each has its own icon and label, and the colour follows the live on/off state. |
| <img src="assets/screens/weather.png" width="170"> | **Weather**<br>A 7-day dial; turn the knob to scroll days. Animated condition icon, colour-coded temperature, and a glow that slides to the selected day. |
| <img src="assets/screens/thermostat.png" width="170"> | **Thermostat**<br>A dial for a `climate.*` entity; the knob sets the target (a head-dot rides the gauge), tap toggles on/off. The whole arc is colour-coded by action - heating / cooling / idle / off. |
| <img src="assets/screens/sensors.png" width="170"> | **Sensors**<br>A glance of 1-6 configurable Home Assistant entities, shown big one at a time; turn the knob to cycle (dots show the position). Each gets its own accent colour. Any entity, pulled straight from HA. |
| <img src="assets/screens/timer.png" width="170"> | **Timer**<br>Set by knob or voice; big countdown with a colour-coded depleting ring (green → amber → red) and a head-dot, SET / RUNNING / PAUSED status, pause/stop, and a fancy alarm screen when it finishes. |
| <img src="assets/screens/cool-cars.png" width="170"> | **Cool Cars**<br>A lane-racing arcade game - the knob steers, dodge traffic and grab coins. |
| <img src="assets/screens/space-wars.png" width="170"> | **Space Wars**<br>A vertical space shooter - the knob steers, auto-fire, survive the waves. |
| <img src="assets/screens/snake.png" width="170"> | **Snake 360**<br>A smooth-steering 360-degree snake - turn the knob to steer the head and the body trails behind, across the whole round screen. |
| <img src="assets/screens/knobuss.png" width="170"> | **Knobuss**<br>A **Gyruss clone**: your ship orbits the rim and auto-fires inward while foes spiral out of a black-hole core - turn the knob to aim and shoot them down. **Every foe that reaches the rim costs a life** (it bursts in an explosion). 3 lives, top-10 scores. |
| <img src="assets/screens/settings.png" width="170"> | **Settings** (swipe down)<br>Display, Home screen, Widgets, LED Ring, Voice Assistant, System; turn the knob to scroll, tap to enter. |
| <img src="assets/screens/demo.png" width="170"> | **Demo**<br>A small, heavily commented example screen (tap flips black ↔ white) to copy when building your own. |
| <img src="assets/screens/ext-media-player.png" width="170"> | **External Media Player**<br>Controls any external media player - HASS.agent, Kodi, a TV, or any device that exposes transport controls as HA button entities. Prev / play-pause / next / mute buttons matching the Player screen style (play/pause and mute icons reflect live state); turn the knob to adjust volume, shown as an amber overlay. Add `ext` to `screen_order`, configure six button entity substitutions, and optionally a read-only `ext_volume_entity` for the volume overlay + a 3-bar equalizer in the header. |

> Optional screens (player, timer, games, weather, thermostat, sensors, external media player, demo) are pickable - choose which compile in and their order; see [Configuration](https://github.com/MichalZaniewicz/esphome-guition-jc3636k718c-va/wiki/Configuration).

## Watchfaces

The home screen has a **selectable look**. Open **Settings → Home → Watchface** and the knob previews each face live, full-screen - tap to keep. **Classic** is built in; **Neon** (big neon digits), **Minecraft** (a blocky day/night scene), **Fortnite** (a battle-royale HUD over a wallpaper) and a heavily-commented **Demo** template are optional files you switch on in your config, and you can copy Demo to build your own (see [Configuration](https://github.com/MichalZaniewicz/esphome-guition-jc3636k718c-va/wiki/Configuration)).

| Classic (built-in) | Neon | Minecraft | Fortnite | Demo (template) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="assets/screens/home.png" width="140"> | <img src="assets/screens/watchface-neon.png" width="140"> | <img src="assets/screens/watchface-minecraft.png" width="140"> | <img src="assets/screens/watchface-fortnite.png" width="140"> | <img src="assets/screens/watchface-demo.png" width="140"> |

On the **Fortnite** face the game HUD carries real data: the blue shield bar is the battery (gold
while charging), the green health bar is how much of the day is left, the "N ALIVE" counter is the
minutes left in the current hour, and the bottom row is room temperature + humidity. The background
is one baked image - point `scripts/gen_fortnite_bg.py` at any wallpaper of yours to reskin it.

## Buying one (AliExpress)

Search for the exact model number and verify the listing matches:

- Model: **Guition JC3636K718** (look for this in the title/photos)
- ESP32-S3, **16 MB flash**, **octal PSRAM**
- 1.8" round **360×360**, driver **ST77916**
- touch **CST816**, rotary **knob**, speaker + mic, **LED ring**

⚠️ **Heads-up:** there's a near-identical board, the **JC3636W518**, with a *different
pinout*. Make sure the listing says **K718**, not W518. More detail on the
[Hardware](https://github.com/MichalZaniewicz/esphome-guition-jc3636k718c-va/wiki/Hardware) wiki page.

## Quick start

> **Requires ESPHome 2026.7.0+** - images use the platform form (`image:` → `- platform: file` / `online_image`), introduced in that release. On older versions they fail to validate. (The LED ring also needs `use_dma`, added in 2025.5.0.)

1. Copy `secrets.example.yaml` → `secrets.yaml` and fill in your Wi-Fi.
2. Copy **`guition-va.yaml`** and **`partitions.csv`** so they sit together with `secrets.yaml`. Edit the `substitutions:` at the top of `guition-va.yaml` (HA URL + your entity IDs + the four control tiles). That thin file is the only firmware file you keep - the core and all screens are **pulled from GitHub at compile time** (see its `packages:` block), as are the fonts, images and sounds.
3. Choose which screens compile in via the `files:` list and their left-to-right order via `screen_order`, both in `guition-va.yaml`.
4. **First flash over USB** - easiest via the **ESPHome dashboard** (GUI) or the CLI; the 16 MB partition table can't be set over OTA, so the first flash is USB, then updates go wireless.
5. In Home Assistant: open the new ESPHome device → assign an Assist pipeline.

To pull the latest changes later: `./build.sh clean guition-va.yaml` (clears the package cache) then `./build.sh run guition-va.yaml`.

## Python Dependency management

The python dependencies and virtual environments are strictly managed by `uv`. Use `uv add ...` instead of `pip install ...` to add a dependency, and `uv run ...` instead of `python ...` to run a script. This ensures the correct versions are used and avoids conflicts with other projects. An additional benefit is that `uv` automatically creates a virtual environment for the project, keeping dependencies isolated. This leads to everyone using this project having the same versions of dependencies, which is crucial for reproducibility and avoiding "it works on my machine" issues.

## Claude Code skill

This repo ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill at
[`.agents/skills/guition-jc3636k718c/`](.agents/skills/guition-jc3636k718c/SKILL.md). It gives the
assistant the correct pinout, ESPHome component choices, and the hard-won gotchas
(the knob isn't quadrature, GPIO0 ring strapping, 16 MB partitions need a USB flash,
LVGL performance limits, lambda/string pitfalls, the battery heuristic).

### Install it

So Claude can use it on any project:

- **User-wide** - copy the folder into `~/.claude/skills/`:
  ```bash
  cp -r .agents/skills/guition-jc3636k718c ~/.claude/skills/
  ```
- **Per-project** - copy it into that project's `.claude/skills/`.

Start a new Claude Code session and ask anything about this board; the skill loads
automatically. See the [wiki](https://github.com/MichalZaniewicz/esphome-guition-jc3636k718c-va/wiki/Claude-Code-Skill) for details.

## Credits / notes

- Pinout and the display `init_sequence` come from the **official manufacturer demo**
  (`JC3636K718_knob_EN`) - this is the correct pinout for the **K718C** board, which
  differs from the otherwise-similar **JC3636W518**.
- The **External Media Player** screen (`base/screens/ext-media-player.yaml`) was
  contributed by [Justblair](https://github.com/Justblair).
- Built with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) + Home Assistant.
